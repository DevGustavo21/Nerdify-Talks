However, in the case of Super Smash Bros. it could be said that the real driving force behind Nintendo's all-against-all was the will of two video game legends to reinvent the genre itself through two elements as intangible as they are essential: talent and Nintendo magic.</p>

                <p>Why is it called Donkey Kong?
                    Master Miyamoto later said that Shigeru wanted a "silly gorilla" and chose "Donkey" because it could represent a more lighthearted and, to a certain extent, stupid creature. Also, they chose "Kong" instead of "Gorilla" because the former was more popular in Japan.</p>
